## Response to incident of sexual harassment

As a human being, I would be deeply disturbed if I witnessed or experienced sexual harassment. I would feel a strong sense of injustice and anger that someone would treat another person in such a disrespectful and harmful way. I would also feel compassion for the victim and want to do whatever I could to help them.

I would first assess the situation to make sure it was safe for me to intervene. If I felt it was safe, I would try to de-escalate the situation by speaking calmly to the harasser and letting them know that their behavior is unacceptable.
I would also offer support to the victim and let them know that they are not alone.

I would first try to remove myself from the situation. If I felt safe to do so, I would confront the harasser and let them know that their behavior is unwelcome. I would also document the incident and report it to the appropriate authorities.
