### The points that were new to me:

- The emphasis on over-communication in various scenarios, especially the tips on informing about issues like internet/electricity problems or unexpected delays during implementation.
- Using tools like Github gists and sandbox environments for sharing code setups efficiently.

### Area for improvement:

- I believe I can improve on managing distractions and maintaining sustained concentration during work hours. To progress in this area, I plan to:
- Implement stricter notification control on my devices, especially during work hours.
- Use productivity apps like TimeLimit or Freedom to limit access to distracting websites.
- Incorporate regular breaks and exercise sessions into my work routine to enhance focus and energy levels.
