# Learning process

### Feynman Technique:

The Feynman Technique is a learning method where you simplify and teach a concept as if explaining it to someone else to solidify understanding.

### In this video, what was the most interesting story or idea for you?

- In the video, the most interesting story or idea is the story of Barbara Oakley herself. She struggled with math and science in school,but she was determined to learn. She enlisted in the army and learned Russian, and she eventually went on to get a PhD in engineering. She has learned how to learn effectively, and she shares her tips with others in this video.

- One of the most important things Oakley has learned is that learning is not just about focusing on a problem. It is also important to relax and let your mind wander. This is because when you relax, your brain is able to make new connections and come up with new ideas.

- Oakley also shares some tips for overcoming procrastination. She suggests using the Pomodoro Technique, which involves working for 25 minutes and then taking a 5-minute break. She also suggests that people with slow thinking styles should not compare themselves to others. Slow thinkers can be just as creative and successful as fast thinkers.

- Finally, Oakley emphasizes the importance of practice and repetition. She says that understanding alone is not enough to master a subject. You also need to practice what you have learned.

### What are active and diffused modes of thinking?

Active thinking involves focused, deliberate concentration on a specific task or idea, while diffused thinking occurs in a more relaxed, unfocused state where the mind can make broader connections and associations between various concepts.

### According to the video, what are the steps to take when approaching a new topic? Only mention the points?

**Prewriting:** Before you start writing, decide what you’ll write about and conduct necessary research. Narrow down your topic, explore relevant sources, and take notes1.

**Identify a Problem:** Define a research problem related to your topic. It could be a practical issue or a theoretical problem. Set objectives and write a problem statement2.

**Formulate Research Questions:** Develop specific research questions based on your problem statement. These questions guide your investigation2.

**Create a Research Design:** Plan the structure and approach for your research. Consider the logical flow and organization of information1.

**Write a Research Proposal:** Summarize your research plan, including the problem, questions, and design. A well-structured proposalsets the foundation for your project2.

### What are some of the actions you can take going forward to improve your learning process?

**Set Clear Goals:** Define specific learning objectives. Understand what i want to achieve and break it down into smaller milestones.

**Diversify Resources:** Explore various learning materials such as books, online courses, podcasts, and videos. Different formats can provide fresh perspectives.

**Review and Reflect:** Regularly revisit what i’ve learned. Reflect on my progress, identify areas for improvement, and adjust my approach accordingly.

**Stay Curious:** Cultivate curiosity. Explore related topics beyond my immediate focus. Curiosity fuels continuous learning.

**Time Management:** Allocate dedicated time for learning. Consistency matters more than cramming.
