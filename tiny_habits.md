## Tiny Habits

### What is most intresting story or idea

The most interesting story or idea in the video is the concept of "tiny habits." BJ Fogg, the speaker, argues that we should forget about trying to make big changes in our lives and instead focus on making tiny, incremental changes. He believes that these tiny changes are more likely to stick in the long run because they are easier to do and require less motivation.

Fogg provides a formula for creating tiny habits: B = MAT. This stands for Behavior = Motivation + Ability - Trigger. In order for a behavior to occur, all three of these elements must be present. Motivation is the desire to do the behavior. Ability is the capacity to do the behavior. And the trigger is the cue that tells us to do the behavior.

### Use B = MAP to make making new habits easier? What are M, A and P.

B = MAP stands for Behavior = Motivation + Ability + Prompt.

M is Motivation, which is your desire or willingness to do something.
A is Ability, which is your capacity to do something.
P is Prompt, which is a trigger that reminds you to do something.

### Why it is important to "Shine" or Celebrate after each successful completion of habit?

The main motto in this is it automatically increases one's confidence and motivation. It means self-encouragement, It works like a reward system in our mind to celebrate more after every completion of habit.
